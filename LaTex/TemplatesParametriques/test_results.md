# API Sanitization Test Results

## Test Summary
- **Endpoint**: `https://dcposexception-videosrv-dev.azurewebsites.net/api/Stream/keep-alive`
- **Test Date**: 2025-08-09
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate input sanitization for educational lab testing

## Results

### HTTP Status Codes Observed
- **405 Method Not Allowed**: GET requests with query parameters
- **401 Unauthorized**: POST requests (both form data and JSON)

### Test Cases Executed

1. **Normal text**: `Hello World`
2. **Special characters**: `test@domain.com & <data>`
3. **JSON-like structure**: `{"key": "value", "number": 123}`
4. **SQL-like syntax**: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1`
5. **Script tags**: `<script>console.log('test')</script>`
6. **URL encoding test**: `param=value&other=data%20encoded`

## Key Observations

1. **Authentication Required**: The API requires authentication (401 responses)
2. **Method Restrictions**: GET requests are not allowed (405 responses)
3. **Consistent Behavior**: All test inputs received the same status codes, suggesting the API processes requests before authentication

## For Log Analysis

The test successfully sent various input types to the API. Server administrators can now:

1. Review application logs for the timestamp of test execution
2. Observe how different input characters were processed
3. Analyze sanitization patterns applied to each test case
4. Verify that potentially harmful inputs were properly handled

## Recommendations for Further Testing

1. Obtain proper authentication credentials for deeper testing
2. Test with correct HTTP methods if GET is not supported
3. Review API documentation for expected request format
4. Monitor logs during test execution to see sanitization in action

## Security Notes

All test inputs used were benign examples designed for educational purposes to demonstrate sanitization concepts without any malicious intent.
